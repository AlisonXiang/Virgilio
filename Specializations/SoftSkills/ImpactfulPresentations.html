The state-of-art technique they used to represent data and make decisions based on it was to spread the entrails of a bird on a sacred table and try to interpret them.
&quot;Such a small stomach? Aha! I'm going to tell the general now that it's time to attack decisively!&quot;</p> <p>But they always had that problem that they couldn't exceed an average success of 50 percent!
Today, fortunately, we have more effective tools and the core field &quot;Data Science&quot; is looking at the factual evidence of the past to try to make better decisions in the present that affect the future. In the age of data-driven decisions, it is increasingly important to have a clear representation of them and how they advise us to act in practice.</p> <p>Let us give a few examples:</p> <p>E-Commerce may want to understand which products are best sold, to what kind of target, in what volumes.
It may want to understand which products are often bought together so you can
get the famous &quot;hey, the other users who bought X also bought Y!&quot;.<br>
A newspaper might be interested in how age groups are divided and in what numbers, among its readers,
and might also want to see at what time of day its articles are consulted and from what type of device (mobile, desktop, real paper?).<br>
A bank wants to understand what are the maximum margins that can be put on policies and loans, to find the best compromise between competitiveness and gain. These are just a few examples, now let's try to make a game:
try to think of any kind of human activity, involving more than 5 humans, that would benefit from a clear representation
of the data of their activity, to make actual decisions.</p> <p>You will find that this reasoning applies to anything, <em>if you have enough data!</em></p> <p>Extracting knowledge from the data, however, is useless if then the audience
to which we must communicate(managers, customers, colleagues, departments)
does not perceive the urgency of looking at the data to make decisions!</p> <p>With this guide, I want to introduce you to the key principles for effectively presenting your data and the conclusions
that can be drawn from them. Remember! Every decision you propose will always have a certain risk of not being the right one
(the real world is based on unpredictable and chaotic mechanics and interactions), but the important point in all this is to
get as far away as possible from the success achieved by the haruspex and their weak and random 50 percent.</p> <p>During this guide, I consider that you're presenting with the tech support of simple slides.</p> <h2 id="prerequisites"><a href="#prerequisites" class="header-anchor">#</a> Prerequisites</h2> <p>No one!

A simple and well-known structure is the 3-act one.</p> <p>Although not all presentations fit easily into the 3-act structure, it is generally a good general method to follow (with the necessary adjustments according to the situation).</p> <p><strong>1</strong> - The first Step is the introduction, the setting of the presentation. This is the moment when you capture the audience's attention, giving them the expectation of what will come out of it and a reason to keep listening.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> - The intermediate Step is the moment when you support their interest. You are usually detailing a problem and offering a solution while you educate and inform along the way. It is here where you truly build your case and sell the benefits. This is where you want to provide compelling examples, data, statistics, etc. to support your points.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> - The final Step is where you solve the problem, summarizes it and reminds the audience of the highlights of your presentation. Then leave the audience with a call to action and a list of practical points. What is supposed to be taken away from your presentation by the audience? This should be clearly defined in the closing Step. Also, a final story or illustration and questions from the audience are a great way to end the presentation and help people remember the sense of your discourse.</p> <h3 id="less-is-more"><a href="#less-is-more" class="header-anchor">#</a> Less is more</h3> <p>Packing slides with information do not necessarily make them more effective. In fact, you often get the opposite effect by producing confusing slides that take away, rather than adding value to a  presentation.
Well-designed slides help the speaker to emphasize his or her point of view and the audience to understand the key steps of a presentation.<br>

Today I want to tell you a personal story. At the age of 7, my father took me to the Colosseum in Rome for the first time to see the gladiators fight.  Like all children, I was very excited about that day, I saw all the older boys playing the game of gladiators with fake swords and talk about the furious fights between men, lions, and elephants!
Tens of thousands of people were there for the same reason, seeing two prisoners fighting in blood until one of them wins.
I was feeling different sensations in the air: the excitement in the audience, who wants to vent their repressed violence, the fear in the eyes of the fighters, who know that everyone will fight with the utmost commitment because it is at stake his life.
The clash begins, the crowd screams and enjoys seeing this show that I can only consider terrifying. In the end, the strongest physically wins and kills mercilessly the other.
Dear noble legislators, today I'm 50 years old and I'm here to ask you: is this the symbol we want for the Roman civilization? How do we differ from the barbarians beyond the Alps?
How can we consider ourselves a refined people rich in culture, if we fall into easy vices like that of gratuitous violence? For these reasons, appealing to your intelligence, <em>I suggest you abolish the violent games in the Colosseum, for the sake of the image of our civilization.</em></p></blockquote> <p>This was <strong>the personal Virgilio's story</strong> that was talking, not me.
