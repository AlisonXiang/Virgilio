**Disclaimer!**

This guide is not intended to be exhaustive of everything you can do with time series data, but to offer you a good overview of the possible approaches you can take or things you should check when dealing them. 

Having that said, let's begin!

## Time Is Money

Whether it is the sale of products, the estimated production of an agricultural field, or the forecast of any activity of a company, time series are an indispensable type of data, which has been used for thousands of years to inform the activities to be done **today**, based on what will happen **tomorrow**. 

In fact, a good estimate in the future of any interest factor, can bring a great saving of time (and money)! 

If you ask any manager will tell you that _time is even more important than money_, because you can convert time into money, _but the opposite is not possible!_ 

Learning to work with time series is a very valuable skill in the real world, and applicable to many situations and problems. 

It is also considered one of the most "difficult" types of data to manage, since _it has additional complexities_ compared to more traditional data such as tabular data or text.

We will see these additional complexities in the section [Time Series Addtional Challenges](#Time-Series-Addtional-Challenges).

Now that you know why it's important to know how to work with time series, it's time to start seeing them in practice!
